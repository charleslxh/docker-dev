      I am having trouble accessing my machine via local IP.
      I set up an openvpn server along with ufw.
      I am able to access the openvpn server machine via private IP just fine but not able to access any other machine via private IP in the same network.
      Is there a rule I can add that will solve my problem or is this unrelated?

      Appreciate the help and great article btw
